    <p> I grew up in North East, MD, and we live right in front of a body of water. My family owns a boat business, and I have grown up working there. At the dealership we sell many different kinds of baots such as: Pontoons, Four Winns, G3, Scout, and Key West. During the summer I either work or go out on the boat.</p>
    <p> I work at the marina in the summer. When I'm at the marina people bring there boats in to get fuel and I will pump their gas. Other people get their boat out of the storage building and I help them get their boats out into the water, sometimes I pump gas for them too. I also clean boats when it is not busy at the docks.</p>
    <p> When I am not working, I am out on the boat having fun with my siblings. I have my boaters liscense so I take my sibilings and cousins out tubing. We tube almost all day, than eat lunch on the boat or go back home to eat lunch. I want to try watr skiing, but I am to scared to.</p>
